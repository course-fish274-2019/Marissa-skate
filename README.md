# tidyr project cleanup

## The purpose of this project is to explore the tidyr package, gain mastery over data organization, and  gain familiarity with creating presentation slides with rmarkdown

Files in order of use:

1. scripts/tidyr_dataclean.Rmd - RMarkdown file containing prose explaining data analysis, code for data analysis and exports one figure 

2. data_raw/ebs2017_2018 - data from three years of bottom trawls in the east Bering Sea. Original data at : https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/data/2017-2018-eastern-bering-sea-shelf-groundfish-bottom-trawl-survey-data)

3. scripts/beringplt.jpg - plot of depth and latitude with seperate plots for each genus

4. classwork/tidyr_classwork.Rmd - RMarkdown file used to practice in class work and test code

5. output/week9_html.html - html export of knit rmarkdown file

6. output/week9_presentation.html - Slideshow made with slidy as export of RMarkdown file


## Game Plan for the next two weeks

1. Add additional data from other arctic trawls and pelagic collections

2. Merge and organize new data and sort by +1000 Genus samples

3. Make at least one scatterplot and barplot to represent comparisons between two species

4. Figure out how to make code that saves as .rmd or presentation html

5. Figure out how to write script that runs other documents
